   <br> <b>Introduction</b>	<br><br>
  Like any human language, Java provides a way to express concepts. If
  successful, this medium of expression will be significantly easier and more
  flexible than the alternatives as problems grow larger and more complex.
  You can’t look at Java as just a collection of features; some of the features make no sense in
  isolation. You can use the sum of the parts only if you are thinking about design, not simply
  coding. And to understand Java in this way, you must understand the problems with it and
  with programming in general. This book discusses programming problems, why they are
  problems, and the approach Java has taken to solve them. Thus, the set of features I explain
  in each chapter are based on the way I see a particular type of problem being solved with the
  language. In this way I hope to move you, a little at a time, to the point where the Java
  mindset becomes your native tongue.<br>
  Throughout, I’ll be taking the attitude that you want to build a model in your head that
  allows you to develop a deep understanding of the language; if you encounter a puzzle
  you’ll be able to feed it to your model and deduce the answer.<br><br>
 Prerequisites<br><br>
This book assumes that you have some programming familiarity; you understand that a
program is a collection of statements, the idea of a subroutine/function/macro, control
statements such as “if” and looping constructs such as “while,” etc. However, you might
have learned this in many places, such as programming with a macro language or working
with a tool like Perl. As long as you’ve programmed to the point where you feel comfortable
with the basic ideas of programming, you’ll be able to work through this book. Of course,
the book will be easier for the C programmers and more so for the C++ programmers, but

don’t count yourself out if you’re not experienced with those languages (but come willing to
work hard). I’ll be introducing the concepts of object-oriented programming and Java’s basic
control mechanisms, so you’ll be exposed to those, and the first exercises will involve the
basic control-flow statements.<br>
Although references will often be made to C and C++ language features, these are not
intended to be insider comments, but instead to help all programmers put Java in perspective
with those languages, from which, after all, Java is descended. I will attempt to make these
references simple and to explain anything that I think a non- C/C++ programmer would
not be familiar with.<br><br>
Learning Java<br><br>
At about the same time that my first book Using C++ (Osborne/McGraw-Hill 1989) came
out, I began teaching that language. Teaching programming languages has become my
profession; I’ve seen nodding heads, blank faces, and puzzled expressions in audiences all
over the world since 1989. As I began giving in-house training with smaller groups of
people, I discovered something during the exercises. Even those people who were smiling and
nodding were confused about many issues. I found out, by chairing the C++ track at the
Software Development Conference for the past few years (and now also the Java track), that
I and other speakers tended to give the typical audience too many topics too fast. So
eventually, through both variety in the audience level and the way that I presented the
material, I would end up losing some portion of the audience. Maybe it’s asking too much,
but because I am one of those people resistant to traditional lecturing (and for most people, I
believe, such resistance results from boredom), I wanted to try to keep everyone up to speed.
For a time, I was creating a number of different presentations in fairly short order. Thus, I
ended up learning by experiment and iteration (a technique that also works well in Java
program design). Eventually I developed a course using everything I had learned from my
teaching experience – one that I would be happy giving for a long time. It tackles the
learning problem in discrete, easy-to-digest steps and in a hands-on seminar (the ideal
learning situation), there are exercises following each of the short lessons. I now give this
course in public Java seminars, which you can find out about at http://www.BruceEckel.com.
(The introductory seminar is also available as a CD ROM. Information is available at the
same Web site.)
The feedback that I get from each seminar helps me change and refocus the material until I
think it works well as a teaching medium. But this book isn’t just a seminar handout – I<br>
tried to pack as much information as I could within these pages and structured it to draw<br>
you through onto the next subject. More than anything, the book is designed to serve the<br>
solitary reader who is struggling with a new programming language.<br><br>
